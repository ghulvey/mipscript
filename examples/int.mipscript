## Hello world from mipscript, this will be in compiled code
# Mipscript does its best to translate your formatting to MIPS assembly
# This is a comment - it will be ignored by the compiler, because it starts with one hash
## This is a comment too - but it will be added to the compiled code, because it starts with two hashes

# The blank lines above and below this comment will be outputted as blank lines in the compiled code

int f = 0;
int y = -1;

## Update the values of f and y

## Print the values of f and y
